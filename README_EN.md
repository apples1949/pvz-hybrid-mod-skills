A **WorkBuddy Agent Skills** collection for modding *Plants vs. Zombies Hybrid Edition* (Godot 4 + C#). It consists of three interlocking skills: a universal `.pmod` package-format encyclopedia, plus two end-to-end pipelines — one for plants, one for zombies. Everything here comes from repeated, real-project testing: every "iron rule" corresponds to an actual pitfall, and every pitfall includes its root cause with engine-source-level evidence.

> 🚀 **First time here? Start with [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md)** — get the official SuperGatlingPea template running, then change one stat to make it your first mod (~30–60 min; requires an unpacked game tree, and let your agent finish the path adaptation per `tools/README.md` first).

## What Is This

A mod for *PvZ Hybrid Edition* is a `.pmod` file (essentially `zip + root mod.json`). The game ships with an F3 in-game GUI mod editor, but it **cannot be driven by AI**; a `.pmod`, however, can be generated purely by scripts — and that is the foundation of this whole skill set.

The three skills turn "from a one-sentence requirement to an installable, playable mod" into operational manuals an AI can execute precisely:

- **Knowledge documents + reusable tools**: the skills deliver validated **methodology and hard constraints** (package format, field semantics, firing pipeline, render pipeline, offline gate design); the generators, gate scripts and the GUI editor they reference are published in this repo under [`tools/`](tools/README.md), ready to reuse or adapt.
- **Why trust it?** Every conclusion defers to engine source code (`addons/ModEditor/ModSystem/`, `Script/Component/`) as the final arbiter, and the verification methodology includes negative tests that prove the gates themselves are not "fake green".

## The Three Skills at a Glance

| Skill | Role | One-liner | Size |
|---|---|---|---|
| **pvz-hybrid-mod-authoring** | Universal base (encyclopedia) | Hand-write/generate `.pmod` of any category: projectiles, maps, characters, shop, audio, atlases…; includes the `mod_editor.py` GUI-editor workflow and a "single screenshot → character sprite" pipeline | Single SKILL.md, ~159 KB |
| **pvz-hybrid-plant-authoring** | Plant-specific pipeline | Build a plant mod from scratch: stats, cards, almanac, firing (rate/count/spread), skins, managed C# plugins (probability/burst/true-random) | SKILL.md + 7 references + 1 checklist |
| **pvz-hybrid-zombie-authoring** | Zombie-specific pipeline | Build a zombie mod from scratch: armor set, three-node head swap, giving zombies firing, muzzle-aligned bullet spawn, almanac dedup | SKILL.md + 3 references |

Relationship: **mod-authoring is the dictionary; plant/zombie are two construction blueprints**. Both pipeline skills declare their boundary up front — package-format details go back to the base skill; sequence and hard constraints follow the pipeline skill.

## Unpacking the Game (mandatory tool: GDRE Tools)

**This is step 0, before anything else.** Every skill and tool in this repo takes an **unpacked game tree** as ground truth — engine source, resource structure, scene nodes and field semantics are all read from it. So **unpack the game before writing any mod**.

> ### ⛔ The game must be unpacked with GDRE Tools (gdsdecomp); other tools and hand-written scripts are not allowed
>
> - **Download: https://github.com/GDRETools/gdsdecomp/releases**
> - **Download notes, usage, self-check and troubleshooting: [UNPACKING.md](UNPACKING.md)** (Chinese)
> - **Explicit constraint for AI agents**: when the task is "unpack the game / obtain its source and assets", the agent **must direct the user to download GDRE from the link above and unpack with it**. It **must not** write its own PCK parser, **must not** call another unpacking tool, and **must not** use a tree produced by anything else as ground truth.
>
> **Why this is hard**: this title is a **Godot 4 + C# (Mono)** project. Only GDRE correctly handles
> ① PCK checksums and encryption, ② binary resources → original text formats, ③ C# assembly resolution and decompilation.
> Trees produced any other way show up as "resources still binary", "missing fields", "`.cs` line numbers don't match" —
> every "source is the arbiter" claim in the skills **silently becomes wrong**.

### Three steps

| Step | What to do |
|---|---|
| **① Download** | Open [Releases](https://github.com/GDRETools/gdsdecomp/releases) and grab the latest **stable** (non pre-release) `GDRE_tools-v<ver>-windows.zip` (~40 MB; Linux/macOS/Android builds available). Unzip and run — **no install needed**; the Windows binary is **`gdre_tools.exe`**. ⚠️ Do not download the "Source code" archives. <br>If unpacking reports a missing **C# assembly**, use `v2.7.0-beta.2`, which fixes exactly that. Scoop users: `scoop bucket add games` → `scoop install gdsdecomp` |
| **② Unpack** | **GUI**: launch `gdre_tools.exe` → menu **"RE Tools" → "Recover project..."** → pick the game's `.pck` (`.exe` / `.apk` / an already-extracted dir also work), or just **drag and drop** the file onto the window; then choose an output directory. <br>**CLI**: `gdre_tools --headless --recover="<pck/exe>" --output="<your dir>"`. <br>★ **`--recover` is required** — only it converts binary resources back to `.tres`/`.tscn` text and decompiles scripts. `--extract` merely dumps files, leaving you with unreadable binaries |
| **③ Self-check** | The tree must contain **all three** of `Asset/`, `Prefab/`, `addons/ModEditor/ModSystem/`, and must contain `Asset/Config/Projectile/ProjectileResource.json`. Once it passes, do the "environment adaptation" in [`tools/README.md`](tools/README.md) and replace the author's hardcoded paths with your own |

Troubleshooting (missing C# assembly / MD5 errors / encryption key / binary-only output / mismatched line numbers) and all details: **[UNPACKING.md](UNPACKING.md)**.

## Installation & Configuration

### Prerequisites

1. **WorkBuddy** (recommended — register via the invitation link at the top): skills are auto-loaded and executed by the WorkBuddy AI agent.
2. An unpacked copy of *PvZ Hybrid Edition* **V0.28** (the skills constantly consult engine source `.cs` files and the `Asset/` structure as ground truth).
   **No unpacked tree yet? See "[Unpacking the Game](#unpacking-the-game-mandatory-tool-gdre-tools)" above — it must be unpacked with GDRE Tools.**
3. See [Environment & Dependencies](#environment--dependencies).

### Steps

1. Clone the repo (or download and extract the ZIP):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-account>/pvz-hybrid-mod-skills.git
   ```

2. Copy the skill folders you need into a skills directory (**each folder installs independently**):

   - **User-level** (available in all projects): `C:\Users\<you>\.workbuddy\skills\`
   - **Project-level** (current project only): `<your-workspace>\.workbuddy\skills\`

   ```bash
   # Example: install all three skills at user level
   cp -r skills/pvz-hybrid-mod-authoring   ~/.workbuddy/skills/
   cp -r skills/pvz-hybrid-plant-authoring ~/.workbuddy/skills/
   cp -r skills/pvz-hybrid-zombie-authoring ~/.workbuddy/skills/
   ```

3. Restart your WorkBuddy session, then just talk to the agent, e.g.:
   - "Make a plant mod with double fire rate" → plant skill triggers;
   - "Give the zombie a sunflower-queen head" → zombie skill triggers;
   - "Change the projectile damage in this .pmod" → mod-authoring triggers.

> Not using WorkBuddy? The skills are structured Markdown knowledge bases and read perfectly well as developer handbooks — start from each SKILL.md's "standard flow" section.

## Skill Details

### 1. pvz-hybrid-mod-authoring (universal base)

**What it does**: the complete encyclopedia of the `.pmod` format. Covers overriding built-in resources (projectiles / maps / characters / levels / shop / collectibles / shovel / lawnmowers / survival / tutorial / NPC dialogue / BGM / audio / textures / atlases) and managed-code mods (C# DLL). Includes the out-of-game GUI editor `mod_editor.py` workflow (edit stats / package / validate without writing code) and a "single character screenshot → character sprite with animation" (matting + frame-by-frame) pipeline.

**Key contents**:

- **Prerequisite mental model**: the in-game F3 editor is a GUI that AI cannot drive; `.pmod = zip + root mod.json` can be script-generated.
- **Package structure**: `mod.json` must be at the root and unique (≤ 1 MiB); categories derive from `Resources/<category>/<file>.tres` path prefixes; packaging exclusion list (`.uid` `.import` `.cs` `.csproj` `.sln` …).
- **Two forms**: `.pmod` (loaded by game) vs project folder (opened by editor) — the classic time-waster.
- **Path-prefix → (category, key) full table** + **iron rules** (violations fail loading).
- **Map deep-dive**: `TowerDefenseMapConfig` coordinates (1-based, closed interval), row-addition geometry, background replacement.
- **Plant / zombie deep-dives**: 6-file plant package, firing pipeline (`ComponentSet`), `FireMarker` muzzle, skin "three-piece set" (`.tscn` + `.tres` + `.dat`), HP & direct-plant-on-empty-ground, the four key zombie-vs-plant differences.
- **Managed-code mods**: four hard constraints, `Runtime/` may contain exactly one `ModAssembly.dll`, entry-class discipline, verifying without launching the game.
- **Character sprite authoring**: matting (including the soft-moss-background failure boundary), part-layered animation, quantified delivery checks.

**How to use**: auto-triggered by WorkBuddy from the description; can also be named explicitly. Use its iron rules and lookup tables as the dictionary for the other two skills.

**Main dependencies**: see [Environment & Dependencies](#environment--dependencies); the GUI editor and matting scripts need Python + Pillow.

### 2. pvz-hybrid-plant-authoring (plant pipeline)

**What it does**: a 12-step end-to-end flow for a plant mod, centered on four decisions: reuse a built-in plant or build fresh; whether a managed C# plugin is required; skin via official-asset conversion or hand-made; whether the card enters the seed-selection UI and almanac.

**Key contents**:

- **12-step standard flow**: gather requirements → clone the generator and edit constants (`CHAR_KEY` must match in four places) → 6-file package → explicitly declare `ComponentSet` (missing = no bullets, zero logs) → data-side firing (salvo vs per-shot hard constraints) → skin → card into selection/almanac (with side effects) → HP / direct-plant → plugin → offline gates → install → in-game acceptance.
- **Top-15 pitfalls**, each with root-cause source references — including the famous "child sprites are always drawn by the parent" (⇒ head swaps require three nodes), `>` silently swallowing `.tscn` node headers, and "assertion wrong the same way as the code = fake green".
- **Gate overview**: layered design of `self_check()`, on-disk assertions, negative tests, offline replication of ModLoader gates, idempotency checks.

**How to use**: ask the agent to "make a plant mod / change fire rate / put my card in the almanac / swap the skin". Before building, the agent opens `assets/新建植物清单.md` (Chinese checklist) to tick off requirements. Details are one lookup away via the reference index at the end of SKILL.md.

**Main dependencies**: Python 3.13+ (generator), .NET SDK (plugin builds), Pillow (official-skin conversion / hand-made skins), unpacked game tree.

### 3. pvz-hybrid-zombie-authoring (zombie pipeline)

**What it does**: the 12-step end-to-end flow for zombie mods — only the zombie path and **every difference from plants**. Zombies have no firing component by default, face left (horizontal flip), and head-follow rendering is special — all made explicit.

**Key contents**:

- **13-file package layout**: card / body config / packet entry / scene / component set / fire definition / sprite scene / armor data / armor slots / skin set / managed plugin — item by item, with hard path constraints (exactly 6 segments, `Zombies` category directory).
- **Armor system**: the Armor three-piece set, near-death rage state machine (newspaper-zombie template).
- **Three-node head swap**: `HeadShadow` + `HeadHolder` + `Head` — why naively swapping a child sprite's texture always yields "fragments of other characters" (parent-draws-child mechanism), and why pushing a child *behind* the parent only works via `insertLayerId`.
- **Giving zombies firing**: add `FireComponent` to the component set, keep exactly 1 entry in `fireProjectileList`, negative `speed` (left-facing = forward), plugin-driven cadence, `CanFireCheckOnceByData` instead of `CanFire`, **bullet spawn point realigned to the muzzle every frame**.
- **Almanac dedup**: the almanac zombie page has two non-deduplicated sources ⇒ runtime reflection dedup.
- **Quantified sizing/positioning discipline** (iron rule 30 in full): "make the head a bit bigger / nudge it up" must never be eyeballed — flood-fill segmentation on the reference image, offline composited rendering to sweep candidate scales, rigid anchors (face/crown, not the frame-animated flame petals).

**How to use**: ask the agent to "make a zombie mod / swap the head / make it shoot / add armor"; references are indexed at the end of SKILL.md.

**Main dependencies**: same as the plant pipeline, plus the `dotnet` CLI for `ModAssembly.dll`.

## Environment & Dependencies

### Hard requirements

| Dependency | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **WorkBuddy** (recommended) | Runtime host for the skills | Register via the [invitation link](https://www.workbuddy.cn/events/invite?inviteCode=ryoc35nu7pi1nq); works as plain docs without it |
| **PvZ Hybrid Edition V0.28 (unpacked)** | Ground-truth source | Skills read `addons/ModEditor/ModSystem/` (`ModLoader.cs`, `XWModManifest.cs`, …) and the `Asset/` structure |
| **[GDRE Tools (gdsdecomp)](https://github.com/GDRETools/gdsdecomp/releases)** | **The only permitted unpacking tool** | ⛔ The game **must** be unpacked with GDRE — other unpackers, third-party PCK tools and hand-written parsers are banned. It is the only tool that handles this Godot 4 + C# (Mono) project's PCK checksums/encryption, binary-resource → text conversion, and C# assembly resolution. See **[UNPACKING.md](UNPACKING.md)** |
| **Python ≥ 3.13** | Generators / gates / validators | Pure-math scripts need no third-party packages |
| **Pillow (PIL)** | Skin conversion, matting, offline rendering, comparison images | `pip install pillow` |

### As needed

| Dependency | When |
|---|---|
| **.NET SDK (`dotnet` CLI)** | Managed C# plugins (probability / burst / true-random / fix-frozen-animation / zombie firing cadence) to build `ModAssembly.dll` |
| **Node.js (optional)** | A few tool scripts |
| **Classic PvZ assets (reanim)** | For the "official-asset conversion" skin route (conversion scripts are not bundled; build your own per the documented pipeline) |

### Companion tools & templates (tools/)

The tools referenced by the skills **are now shipped in this repo** — see [tools/README.md](tools/README.md): the `.pmod` toolchain (`build_pmod.py` / `verify_pmod.py` / stat hot-patch / GUI editor `mod_editor.py`), template generators and managed C# plugin sources for all four pipelines, offline gate & head-fit quantification scripts, the official-asset conversion pipeline (reanim → `.dat`/`.tres`/atlas), and five full case-study delivery documents.

⚠️ These scripts come from the author's Windows environment and **some paths are hardcoded** (unpacked game tree, dual game builds). Replace them with your own paths per the "environment adaptation" section in `tools/README.md`. Version baseline is V0.28; after engine updates, defer to `addons/ModEditor/ModSystem/` source as the final arbiter.

## Standard Workflow (How the Skills Fit Together)

```
Requirement ("a sunflower-queen zombie that shoots")
   │
   ├─ ① mod-authoring: look up format & iron rules (mod.json fields, path→category table, plugin constraints)
   │
   ├─ ② zombie-authoring: walk the 12 steps
   │      Step 0 gather requirements → clone generator → 13-file package → three-node head swap
   │      → add FireComponent → managed plugin (cadence / can-fire / head pose / spawn point)
   │      → card-bank registration & almanac dedup
   │
   ├─ ③ Offline gates (gate overviews in both pipeline skills): self-check + on-disk assertions
   │      + negative tests + offline-replicated ModLoader validation + idempotency (3 runs, byte-stable)
   │
   └─ ④ Install & in-game acceptance: drop .pmod into
          %APPDATA%\Godot\app_userdata\植物大战僵尸杂交版\Mods\
          → confirm via [ModLoader] lines in PVZHE_Logs → verify visual items in game
```

For plant mods, swap ② for the plant-authoring 12 steps.

## Important Notes

1. **Absolute paths inside the skills are the author's environment examples** (`D:\zzz\pvzHE\...`, `C:\Users\...`). They describe *where each kind of information lives* (unpacked tree, logs, mod install dir); replace them with your own equivalents. The game's user-data dir is fixed: `%APPDATA%\Godot\app_userdata\植物大战僵尸杂交版\`.
2. **Version baseline is V0.28**. Engine updates may change fields, gates, or behavior — always defer to `addons/ModEditor/ModSystem/` and `Script/Component/` source; the skills teach exactly how to arbitrate with source.
3. **Never manually delete `ModsCache`**. Restart the game after changing a package; the cache is managed automatically.
4. **No `.cs` files inside the package, ever** (same for `.exe`/`.bat`/`.cmd`/`.ps1` and other executables); `Runtime/` may contain exactly one `ModAssembly.dll`, otherwise the whole package is rejected.
5. **The in-game F3 editor cannot be automated** (GUI); all automation goes through "generate `.pmod` purely by script".
6. **Self-checks must be paired with negative tests**. Memory-text-only self-checks go "fake green" (assertion wrong the same way as the code); the skills insist every assertion be tamper-tested.
7. **Entering the card bank/almanac has side effects** (gold-card shard drops, random card draws) — the skills require informing the player; keep that step.
8. **Dual-build setups run gates twice**: the author's machine keeps remake/console builds; a single-build user runs each gate once.
9. **Respect the community rules**: mods are for personal, non-commercial use; respect the copyright and work of the original game and Hybrid Edition authors.

## FAQ

**Q1: My plant's animation plays but no bullets spawn, and nothing is logged?**
The two most common causes: ① the character scene does **not explicitly declare `ComponentSet`** (it inherits the base one without FireComponent — completely silent); ② the animation `events` table has **no `fire` entry** — normal firing is 100% animation-event driven; setting `fireAnimeClips` alone is not enough. See plant skill Step 4 / Step 5.

**Q2: Custom-skin animation is fully frozen and only advances one frame per ESC pause?**
A self-made `.dat` is not in the global atlas list ⇒ GPU pose texture invalid ⇒ frozen. Fix: a managed plugin sets `forceLocalRender = true` + `forceCpuPoseRender = true` at runtime. ⚠️ Only works if the sprite is not drawn by a parent — for child sprites it silently does nothing; use the three-node structure.

**Q3: After a head swap the head renders as fragments of other characters?**
The engine collects "direct child sprites of a sprite" by node type and **draws them in the parent's batch**, sampling the parent's shared all-characters atlas ⇒ a cross-`.tres` child sprite is always wrong. The only fix is the three-node structure (shadow consumes positioning, plain container breaks parent-drawing, visible head renders independently). See zombie skill Step 5.

**Q4: My `.pmod` is rejected outright / rolled back on load?**
Check the four hard constraints: `runtimeAssembly` must literally be `Runtime/ModAssembly.dll`; `runtimeApiVersion = 1`; callbacks must never throw; `provides`/`overrides` must declare every recognized file in the package. Also: one extra file in `Runtime/` (even `.pdb`) triggers rejection. Search `[ModLoader]` lines in `PVZHE_Logs` for keywords.

**Q5: I changed the C# source but behavior didn't change?**
Generators **never rebuild the DLL automatically** — after editing `.cs` run a separate build (two compiles compared by sha256), otherwise the package still carries the old DLL.

**Q6: "Make the head bigger / nudge it up" — guessed numbers keep being wrong?**
Iron rule: **never eyeball size/position**. With a reference image, measure it (flood-fill segmentation + offline render scale sweep + rigid anchors). Without one, take a conservative value from project precedent. And **changing `head_scale` always requires re-solving `head_offset`**. See zombie skill pitfall 11 and references §10.

**Q7: Do I need a managed plugin?**
Only for what pure data cannot do: probability triggers, timed/mode-switching fire, true randomness, per-shot firing, projectile replacement, unfreezing custom skins. Rate/count/spread/damage/cost/cooldown/card type are all pure data — don't add plugins "just to be safe".

**Q8: `Animation/LayerVisible` won't hide a layer (e.g. an extra head appears)?**
Quotes must wrap the **entire** property name: `"Animation/LayerVisible/图层_1" = false`. Quoting only the tail (`Animation/LayerVisible/"图层_1"`) makes the line **completely ineffective**, silently, and the layer stays visible.

**Q9: Should I ship translations.csv in the package?**
No. Write the Chinese name directly in the `translate` field; `translations.csv` is editor-only and merely adds a harmless diagnostic.

**Q10: Can these skills work with other AI tools?**
They are plain Markdown (frontmatter + body), so the content is portable; the "auto-trigger by description, auto-run gates" experience depends on WorkBuddy. Any AI tool with custom system prompts / knowledge bases can consume them manually.

## Contributing (Issue / PR guidelines)

> **⚠️ Every `SKILL.md` in this repo is loaded by an AI as instructions.** A single wrong statement keeps
> misleading every future session — so this repository demands evidence, not impressions.

Full guidelines: **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** (Chinese, with an English TL;DR). Key points:

| Topic | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Issues** | Use the forms under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` (blank issues are disabled). Title: `[type] one-line conclusion`. **Incomplete is fine** — write `未确认` / *unconfirmed* or `待补充` / *to be filled in*; incomplete issues are not closed. |
| **PR branch** | `<type>/<scope>-<desc>`, type ∈ `feat` `fix` `docs` `tools` `chore` |
| **Commit subject** | `<scope>: <imperative summary>` (≤72 chars, English, no trailing period). **Merging is squash-only, so the PR title becomes the commit subject.** |
| **Verification** | **Recommended, not required**: skill-content fixes benefit from a before/after comparison, tool/generator changes from **on-disk assertions + negative tests** output. Never label unverified work as verified, and avoid "false green" assertions if you touch gates ([CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) §3.4). |
